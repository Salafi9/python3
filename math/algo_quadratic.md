Programme Design and Executions Steps.

1. Start
2. Collect the coefficients of a and b and the constant c.
3. Validate the values of a, b and c, to be floats.
4. Check if value of a is zero, return "Value Error" and exit. Otherwise pass. 
5. The Discriminant Variable dis takes the value b^2-4ac.
6. Calculate the value of the discriminant dis.
7. Check if discriminant dis is greather than 0, calculate the roots and print them out to 3 decimal places.
8. Check if discriminant dis is equivalent to 0, calculate the roots and print them out to 3 decimal places.
9. If the discriminant dis is lessthan 0, then we have a complex root, calculate them and print out to 3 decimal places.
10. Terminate.
